## Run the container

Find instructions on pulling the container [here](https://git.clortox.com/Infrastructure/-/packages/container/filebrowser/latest).
You can also build the container locally by running the docker compose included with this repository

```bash
docker compose up
# Older docker compose
docker-compose up
```

## Run as a sidecar in k8s

I use this container as a k3s/k8s sidecar container, to provide a nice interface to the contents of specific longhorn
volumes (such as plex, or minecraft servers). Below I have included a sample deployment definition. Be sure to place
secrets in a [kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)!


```yaml
containers:
  - name: filebrowser
    image: git.clortox.com/infrastructure/filebrowser:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    env:
      - name: ADMIN_PASS
        value: "admin"
      - name: DEFAULT_USERNAME
        value: "user"
      - name: DEFAULT_PASSWORD
        value: "password"
      - name: BRANDING_NAME
        value: "My File Storage"
      - name: AUTH_METHOD
        value: "json"
      - name: AUTH_HEADER
        value: "X-My-Header"
      - name: PERM_ADMIN
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_EXECUTE
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_CREATE
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_RENAME
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_MODIFY
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_DELETE
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_SHARE
        value: "false"
      - name: PERM_DOWNLOAD
        value: "false"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: volume-name
        mountPath: /srv
```

Note however that if you want to use a reverse proxy like [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io) for your authentication,
you will need to update the [auth method](https://filebrowser.org/configuration/authentication-method#proxy-header)
